        <br/>
        <p>The idea of ​​the platform appeared simultaneously with our attempts to search through the local websites for a real estate opportunity for the family, and the search periods were long due to the fake, expired, and unclear property ads, therefore appeared the need to build a platform specialized real estate.
<br/>
<br/>
We searched for more than two years, communicated with owners and investors, visited advertised real estate, and talk with all parties, trying to study the real estate market in Palestine. This research resulted in a deeper understanding of the real estate market problems.
<br/>
<br/>
We started working on the idea starting from the last quarter of 2020, we first formed the idea and searched for the best framework capable of growth and development, and then we searched for a name that fits the idea. So we searched a lot until we found the name "Palestine" available for sale, so we contacted the owner Immediately after strenuous efforts, we got the name and began to work hard, continuing night with day to accomplish the first step, which is launching the website during record time, forgetting the obstacles imposed on us dreaming of the near future.
<br/>
<br/>
The basic idea of ​​the platform expresses a specialized real estate market that is open to all owners, investors, and interested parties through easy, simple, and direct advertising mean. This makes the platform unique for the local market via the Internet and a center for communication and marketing in an attempt to attract investments and contribute to finding real estate opportunities and making them available to all.

<p>Our vision for the platform is to help create a reliable and safe place by creating a platform that will be the link between all interested parties to become the first real estate destination in the country.</p>
